# Bhumi Volunteering Impact Analysis

[**Bhumi**](https://www.bhumi.ngo/) is one of India’s largest youth-led NGOs, founded in 2006 with the vision of building an equal and socially conscious society. Every year, over 30,000 volunteers engage in education, community development, and environmental initiatives.

Bhumi runs impactful programs such as **Ignite**, **Catalyse**, and **Fellowship**, all aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

- **Advancing Quality Education & Reducing Inequality:** Providing holistic education and sustainable livelihood pathways for underprivileged children.

- **Promoting Sustainable Cities & Communities:** Civic engagement activities such as cleanups, tree planting, and sustainability awareness campaigns. Encouraging volunteering as a national habit to drive large-scale social change.

I had the privilege of contributing to this mission through a data storytelling project on the [**Data Change Makers**](https://www.datachangemakers.org/) platform — a space that connects Non-Profits and Social Impact Organizations with Data Professionals and Enthusiasts to deliver data-driven solutions and create meaningful impact.

Using real-world volunteering data provided by Bhumi, I analyzed volunteer engagement and outcomes to uncover trends, generate insights, and visualize the program’s social impact.

The project features an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that tells a compelling story of Bhumi’s volunteering impact.
## Dataset Overview:

This project uses two datasets:

- **Civic Volunteering**: Covers events, dates, causes, locations, volunteer hours, impact metrics (e.g., trash collected), and club details.

- **Corporate Volunteering**: Includes the same structure, along with anonymized corporate partner details, CSAT (satisfaction scores), and delivery models.

The datasets capture information about events, such as when and where they took place, their duration, and volunteer participation (hours contributed, outputs achieved, and roles performed).

Data Source: Collected through Bhumi’s internal systems, maintained by teams and volunteers.
## Analytical Tools:
For this project, I used the following tools and technologies: 

- **Power BI**
## Key Visualizations:
**Interactive Power BI Dashboard**: A dynamic, user-friendly dashboard with multiple pages, including- 
- **Overall Volunteering**
- **Civic Volunteering**
- **Corporate Volunteering**
- **Volunteering Impact & Outcomes**.

The dashboard consolidates key metrics and visual stories to effectively highlight program impact.

## Demo:
Had the privilege to present my Bhumi Volunteering Impact Dashboard at the [**Data Change Makers Live Volunteer Showcase event**](https://youtu.be/qQygrhCpyh0?si=9PNgq20lntZHOFkX). My work was selected along with 3 others volunteer reports for this showcase.
